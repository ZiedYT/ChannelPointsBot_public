        - You can create multiple variations each with their bits amount:
          - Example: Multiple timeout options, the longer the duration the more bits are needed
      - IF YOU ARE USING TWO VARIATIONS OF THE SAME ACTION (EXAMPLE BITS AND CHANNEL POINTS) MAKE SURE THE STACKABLE PARAMETER IS ON
